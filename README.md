## Description

Developed by the Open University’s Knowledge Management Institute, DebateHub is a tool for online communities to: raise issues; share ideas; debate the pros and cons; and prioritise contributions in order to collectively organise and progress good ideas forward. Debate Hub is distinctive in its use of advanced analytics to show the best argued ideas, and visualisations of a community.

Key Features
 - A ***grouping*** mechanism to set up discussion groups.
 - An intuitive linear interface for ***argumentation-based discussion***.
 - 2-D mapping canvases to connect ideas and build argument maps.
 - New mechanisms to ***prioritise*** issues, ideas and arguments.
 - A ***Moderator toolbar*** to allow re-structuring and organisation of the debate by merging and splitting ideas and arguments.
 - A ***Visualisation Dashboard*** to support community management and sense making of the debate.

Public deliberation in complex socio-technical debates is critical, but poorly supported by today’s social media platforms: it is hardly possible for citizens and community managers to quickly grasp the state of a public debate, know where they might best contribute to advance understanding, and effectively identify and pursue socially innovative ideas.

DebateHub is an innovative tool for community deliberation that provides an intuitive interface for large-scale argumentation and advanced analytics and visualisations to enhance sensemaking, attention mediation and community moderation.

DebateHub helps communities to identify the most robust ideas in the noise. It provides a collaboration environment in which ideas can be debated and assessed, in a way that it is not the most popular idea to win, but the one for which the best arguments are brought forward and the best evidence are provided.

DebateHub also supports informed participation to public debates by providing a collective intelligence visualization dashboard consisting of summary analytics and attention mediation feedback. These features support newcomers to get a sense of where is the debate at and where is the best way for them to contribute. The DebateHub Visualization Dashboard is also a tool for community managers to monitor their community, promote attention and prioritize community’s resources and actions.

DebateHub is one of the Catalyst’s ecosystem of Collective Intelligence Tools to improve community deliberation of complex societal challenges.
