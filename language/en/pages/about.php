$LNG->PAGE_ABOUT_BODY .= '<p>Public deliberation in complex socio-technical debates is critical, but poorly supported by today\'s social media platforms: it is hardly possible for citizens and community managers to quickly grasp the state of a public debate, know where they might best contribute to advance understanding, and effectively identify and pursue socially innovative ideas.</p>';
$LNG->PAGE_ABOUT_BODY .= '<p>DebateHub is an innovative tool for community deliberation that provides an intuitive interface for large-scale argumentation and advanced analytics and visualisations to enhance sensemaking, attention mediation and community moderation.</p>';
$LNG->PAGE_ABOUT_BODY .= '<p>DebateHub helps communities to identify the most robust ideas in the noise. It provides a collaboration environment in which ideas can be debated and assessed, in a way that it is not the most popular idea to win, but the one for which the best arguments are brought forward and the best evidence are provided.</p>';
$LNG->PAGE_ABOUT_BODY .= '<p>DebateHub also supports informed participation to public debates by providing a collective intelligence visualization dashboard consisting of summary analytics and attention mediation feedback. These features support newcomers to get a sense of where is the debate at and where is the best way for them to contribute. The DebateHub Visualization Dashboard is also a tool for community managers to monitor their community, promote attention and prioritize community\'s resources and actions.</p>';
